<p>Here, we’ll import multiple subjects from the LIMO-dataset and compute
group-level beta-coefficients for a continuous predictor, in addition we show
how confidence (or significance) levels can be computed for this effects
using the bootstrap-t technique and spatiotemporal clustering and
threshold-free cluster enhancement</p>
